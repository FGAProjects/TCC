 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

  An important part in the development of projects, whatever they may be, are the meetings, because it is in them that the topics raised by the project managers and the interested people are discussed. The leaders of these meetings can estimate delivery times, and from these, measure the level of satisfaction of their employees. Conducting a meeting is first of all, ensuring that everyone involved with the project is aware of what is happening and that they have common points of view. The problem generated by the high number of ineffective meetings, the increase in the dissatisfaction of those involved and the cost to manage a meeting are already points that raised studies on the theme and these are the basis that drive this work.
