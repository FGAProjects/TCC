 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

  Managing meetings is an important area in a company's process, since it is through meetings, whether in person or not, that managers develop their projects. The leaders of these meetings can estimate delivery times, and from there they can measure the level of satisfaction of their employees. Conducting a meeting is first of all knowing that everyone involved in the project is aware of the events and have common points of view, thus giving the feeling of being part of something and especially making those involved feel satisfied with the project. The problem of the high number of ineffective meetings, the increased dissatisfaction of stakeholders and the cost of running a meeting are already points of study and these studies are one of the points that drive this work. Given these problems, this work aims to develop a tool that helps managers in conducting their projects and meetings.
